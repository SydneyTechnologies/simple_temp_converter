## Simple Temperature Converter

This is a simple API built with FastAPI that takes in an input string as a query parameter in the /temperature route and converts the value from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa. The endpoint is also able to return html data and a picture depicting the temperature that was converted. There is no real application for this App it really is just a simple demo for how to use Open API specifications to define actions when creating a custom GPT.

### Endpoints

1. /temperature
2. /tofahrenheit
3. /tocelcius
4. /html
5. /image
